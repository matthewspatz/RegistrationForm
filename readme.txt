I recognize that a more formal implementation of react would use a toolchain and a package.json etc.  
I chose to use a very basic implementation with script tags and babel because as discussed 
in my initial interview, I have very little prior experience with javascript frontends like 
angular or react, most of what I have done used just libraries such as jQuery.  
Therefore, I just wanted to demonstrate the ability to learn about
these concepts and create a basic form.  I did play with the create-react-app environment as well but felt
using it would misrepresent my actual level of understanding at this point.
